	abstract = {In light microscopy, illuminating light is passed through the sample as uniformly as possible over the field of view. For thicker samples, where the objective lens does not have sufficient depth of focus, light from sample planes above and below the focal plane will also be detected. The out-of-focus light will add blur to the image reducing the resolution. In fluorescence microscopy, any dye molecules in the field of view will be stimulated, including those in out-of-focus planes. Confocal microscopy provides a means of rejecting the out-of-focus light from the detector such that it does not contribute blur to the images being collected. This technique allows for high-resolution imaging in thick tissues., In a confocal microscope, the illumination and detection optics are focused on the same diffraction-limited spot in the sample, which is the only spot imaged by the detector during a confocal scan. To generate a complete image, the spot must be moved over the sample and data collected point by point. A significant advantage of the confocal microscope is the optical sectioning provided, which allows for 3D reconstruction of a sample from high-resolution stacks of images. Several types of confocal microscopes have been developed for this purpose and each has different advantages and disadvantages. This paper provides a concise introduction to confocal microscopy.},

	abstract = {In this study we investigated the contact characteristics of human prostate cancer cells (PC3) on silicon micropillar arrays with complex shapes by using high-resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy techniques. These arrays consist of micropillars that are of various cross-sectional geometries which produce different deformation profiles in adherent cells. Fluorescence micrographs reveal that some DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-stained nuclei from cells attached to the pillars develop nanometer scale slits and contain low concentrations of DNA. The lengths of these slits, and their frequency of occurrence, were characterized for various cross-sectional geometries. These DNA-depleted features are only observed in locations below the pillar’s top surfaces. Results produced in this study indicate that surface topography can induce unique nanometer scale features in the PC3 cell.},

	abstract = {In optics, a Gaussian beam is an idealized beam of electromagnetic radiation whose amplitude envelope in the transverse plane is given by a Gaussian function; this also implies a Gaussian intensity (irradiance) profile. This fundamental (or TEM00) transverse Gaussian mode describes the intended output of many lasers, as such a beam diverges less and can be focused better than any other. When a Gaussian beam is refocused by an ideal lens, a new Gaussian beam is produced. The electric and magnetic field amplitude profiles along a circular Gaussian beam of a given wavelength and polarization are determined by two parameters: the waist w0, which is a measure of the width of the beam at its narrowest point, and the position z relative to the waist.
Since the Gaussian function is infinite in extent, perfect Gaussian beams do not exist in nature, and the edges of any such beam would be cut off by any finite lens or mirror. However, the Gaussian is a useful approximation to a real-world beam for cases where lenses or mirrors in the beam are significantly larger than the spot size w(z) of the beam
Fundamentally, the Gaussian is a solution of the axial Helmholtz equation, the wave equation for an electromagnetic field. Although there exist other solutions, the Gaussian families of solutions are useful for problems involving compact beams.},
